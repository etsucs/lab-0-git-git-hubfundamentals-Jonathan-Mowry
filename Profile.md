This is my profile.

My name is Jonathan 'Jon' Mowry. I am 22 years old as of now.

I'm still new to this whole GitHub thing and I'm interested in learning about it.

I'm working on a game for fun. Its kind of like an idle attack the other text based game. Its also coded in C#

I have no plans on actually releasing this or publishing it, its just a fun little project.

I am married to my wonderful wife Veronica and I have a job in Web Development.

I am interested in learning more about C#

That's all signing off!
