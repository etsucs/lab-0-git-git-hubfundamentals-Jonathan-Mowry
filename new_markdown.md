# Hello World!
## This is some text I wrote.

### Here is my notes
I.	What is GitHub / Version Control System (VCS)
  a.	Manage files and directories
  b.	Track changes over time
  c.	Recall previous versions
  d.	Source Control is a subset of VCS
  e.	Created by Linus Torvalds, April 2005
  f.	Over 90% (2018) of companies use Git for version control
II.	Git is a distributed Version Control (DVC)
  a.	No need to connect to a central server
III.	Repository 
  a.	Used to organize a single project
  b.	Can contain folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and any other data constructs
IV.	Branching
  a.	Different versions but the baseline doesn’t change
  b.	If it doesn’t work, delete the branch
  c.	If it does then add it to the baseline
V.	Main
  a.	Starting branch
  b.	Latest working commit
  c.	You don’t change these, you branch off of this
VI.	Commits	
  a.	Once your new branch off main has been created, it is time to start making changes
  b.	Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you’re making a commit and adding them to your branch
  c.	Each commit has an associated commit message
  d.	Work in small segments
VII.	Pull Requests
  a.	Pushes code onto main branch or another branch
VIII.	Merge and Deploy
  a.	Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your tests, you can deploy your changes to verify them in production
  b.	If an issue arises, you can roll back it a previous version
  c.	Pull requests preserve a record of the historical changes to your code
